    "In this Jupyter Notebook you can make a Source Region to be used in the WAM2layers model. A source region is defined as a region with zeros and ones. The regions with the value 1 are recognised by the model to track the precipitation events (in case of backtracking) from this region solely. The regions where from where no precipitation should be tracked, are denoted as 0.\n",
