    "In this Jupyter Notebook you can make a Tagging Region to be used in the WAM2layers model. A tagging region is defined as a region with zeros and ones. The regions with the value 1 are recognised by the model to track the precipitation events (in case of backtracking) or evaporation (in case of forward tracking) from this region solely. The regions where from where no tracking should take place, are denoted as 0.\n",
