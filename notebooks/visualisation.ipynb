    "\n",
    "- Logfile. This function provides a logfile (.txt) with the evaporation recycling ratio (evaporated water that returns as precipitation), pecipitation recycling ratio (regionï¿½s dependence on evaporation from within the region for precipitation), sum of the precipitation, evaporation and their respective absolute differnce. This distance should be kept to a minimum and can be used as a check whether the model is operated correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Precipitation. This function develops a figure showing the precipitation events tracked by WAM2Layers. It visualises the source region accompanied by the precipitation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaporation. This function develops a figure showing the tracked evaporation (showing source and sinks) from the source region, with the accompanying moisture fluxes (arrows) and mean surface pressure (contours in hPa).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moisture_fluxes. This function develops figures showing the mean moisture fluxes (arrows) with their corresponding magnitude (contours). It develops a figure for a specific time range and for both the lower and upper layer of the model (seperated by the p_divide). \n",
