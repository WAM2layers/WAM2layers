WAM2layers is an atmospheric moisture tracking model. It can be used to determine where
precipitation originally evaporated (backtracking), or where evaporated moisture
eventually ends up (forward tracking).

The animation above illustrates the concept of backtracking: you first see the water
content and fluxes move forward in time (left panel). Midway through, the animation
reverses and the moisture from the "source region" is tracked backward in time (right panel).

## How does it work

The simplest experiment with WAM2layers could look like this

```sh
pip install wam2layers[viz]
wam2layers download example-input-eiffel
cd example-input-eiffel
wam2layers preprocess era5 config-eiffel.yaml
wam2layers track config-eiffel.yaml
wam2layers visualize output config-eiffel.yaml
```

See the [documentation](https://wam2layers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a more detailed description. We also have a [video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/QudlILlZnOg)!
