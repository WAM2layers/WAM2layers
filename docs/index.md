# Welcome to WAM2layers!

Welcome to the documentation of the WAM2layers moisture tracking code.
WAM2layers can be used to determine where precipitation originally evaporated
(backtracking), or where evaporated moisture eventually ends up (forward
tracking).

WAM2layers is written in Python and is most easy to use as a command line tool
with configuration script that can be edited in your favorite editor.

* We highly recommended to read the [theory](./theory.md) of tracking in
  WAM2layers before starting your experiments.
* To access source code, see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WAM2layers/WAM2layers)
