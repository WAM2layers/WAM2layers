# Using Remote Input Data

WAM2layers supports loading input data directly from **OpenDAP**, allowing you to skip downloading and preprocessing steps and move straight to running tracking experiments.

As a basis, [Bakels et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.4121/00f7fa45-899e-4573-ae23-234f6c5193d0.v1) provides 73 years of preprocessed ERA5 data available via the 4TU ResearchData repository. This dataset:

* covers the period **1941â€“2014**
* is regridded to a resolution of **0.5Â° Ã— 0.5Â°**

## Example Configuration

The example below shows how to set up a configuration file that uses the remote dataset:

```yaml
# General settings
preprocessed_data_folder: https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/dodsC/data2/djht/00f7fa45-899e-4573-ae23-234f6c5193d0/1
output_folder: ./output_data
tracking_direction: backward

# Preprocessing (not used here but required)
filename_template: ./ERA5_{year}-{month:02d}-{day:02d}{levtype}_{variable}.nc
preprocess_start_date: "2021-07-01T00:00"
preprocess_end_date: "2021-07-15T00:00"
level_type: model_levels
levels: [20,40,60,80,90,95,100,105,110,115,120,123,125,128,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137]

# Tracking
tracking_domain: [0, 50, 10, 55]  # subdomain (west, south, east, north)
tracking_start_date: "1953-01-25T00:00"
tracking_end_date: "1953-02-02T00:00"

# Tagging
tagging_region: [-4.0, 49.5, 6.0, 56.0]
tagging_start_date: "1953-01-31T00:00"
tagging_end_date: "1953-02-02T00:00"

# Simulation settings
input_frequency: "1h"
timestep: 600
output_frequency: "1D"
restart: false
periodic_boundary: false
kvf: 3
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** `preprocessed_data_folder` points to a **remote URL** instead of a local directory.


## Running the Experiment

Save the configuration as `watersnoodramp.yaml` and run:

```bash
wam2layers track watersnoodramp.yaml
```


```{Admonition} Convenience vs performance
:class: tip

Fetching data on the fly is slower. In our test case, running with local files was about 5Ã— faster (excluding the initial download time). Performance will vary with your internet connection, so weigh the convenience of remote access against speed when choosing your setup.
