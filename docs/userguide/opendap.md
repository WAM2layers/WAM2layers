# Using Remote Preprocessed Data

WAM2layers supports loading preprocessed data directly from **OpenDAP**, allowing you to skip downloading and preprocessing steps and move straight to running tracking experiments.

As a basis, [Bakels et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.4121/00f7fa45-899e-4573-ae23-234f6c5193d0.v1) provides 83 years of preprocessed ERA5 data available via the 4TU ResearchData repository. This dataset:

* covers the period **1941â€“2024**
* is regridded to a resolution of **0.5Â° Ã— 0.5Â°**
* uses the 'standard' model level configurations with 22 model levels

## Example Configuration

In the configuration file the preprocessed data folder uses a remote dataset:

```yaml
# General settings
preprocessed_data_folder: https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/dodsC/data2/djht/00f7fa45-899e-4573-ae23-234f6c5193d0/1
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** `preprocessed_data_folder` points to a **remote URL** instead of a local directory.


## Running the Experiment

Example configuration files that work with OpenDAP can be found [here](https://github.com/WAM2layers/WAM2layers/tree/main/configs).
You run them as any other configuration file. These mimic the examples mentioned under 
[Example data](https://wam2layers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/input.html#example-data), 
but with lower resolution and thus based on already preprocessed data.

```bash
wam2layers track opendap-config-eiffel.yaml
wam2layers track opendap-config-volta.yaml
```


```{Admonition} Convenience vs performance
:class: tip

Fetching data on the fly is slower. In our test case, running with local files was about 5Ã— faster (excluding the initial download time). Performance will vary with your internet connection, so weigh the convenience of remote access against speed when choosing your setup.

## 0.25Â° vs. 0.5Â° data
Differences between the **0.5Â° Ã— 0.5Â°** and **0.25Â° Ã— 0.25Â°** data were found to lead only to small differences for the example cases. 
Note, that the differences can be caused by an interplay between differences in ERA5 data, resolution and internal time step of the tracking as well as slightly different tagging regions as original 0.25Â° mask could not perfectly be mimicked with the 0.5Â° data.
