# Using Remote Preprocessed Data

WAM2layers supports loading preprocessed data directly from **OpenDAP**, allowing you to skip downloading and preprocessing steps and move straight to running tracking experiments.

As a basis, [Bakels et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.4121/00f7fa45-899e-4573-ae23-234f6c5193d0.v1) provides 83 years of preprocessed ERA5 data available via the 4TU ResearchData repository. This dataset:

* covers the period **1941â€“2024**
* is regridded to a resolution of **0.5Â° Ã— 0.5Â°**
* uses the 'standard' model level configurations with 22 model levels

## Example Configuration

In the configuration file the preprocessed data folder uses a remote dataset:

```yaml
# General settings
preprocessed_data_folder: https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/dodsC/data2/djht/00f7fa45-899e-4573-ae23-234f6c5193d0/1
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** `preprocessed_data_folder` points to a **remote URL** instead of a local directory.


## Running the Experiment

Example configuration files that work with OpenDAP can be found [here](https://github.com/WAM2layers/WAM2layers/tree/main/configs). 
You run them as any other configuration file, for example:

```bash
wam2layers track opendap-config-volta.yaml
```


```{Admonition} Convenience vs performance
:class: tip

Fetching data on the fly is slower. In our test case, running with local files was about 5Ã— faster (excluding the initial download time). Performance will vary with your internet connection, so weigh the convenience of remote access against speed when choosing your setup.
