# User guide

In this section we provide detailed information about all the steps involved in
running WAM2layers. By the end of this page, you will be familiar with the
different functionalities of WAM2layers, and have a basic understanding of how
the program works. Moreover, you will understand how you can set up your own
experiments with WAM2layers. This guide can also be used as a reference to
quickly find some specific information.

If you are looking for a quick, high-level overview of all the steps, you may
prefer to visit our [quickstart](../quickstart) instead.
