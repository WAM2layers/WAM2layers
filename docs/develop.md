# Developer's guide

This section of the documentation is currently being developed.

### code adaptation and contribution
Possibly you want to adapt WAM2layers to track other climate data (e.g., output of RCMs and GCMs). In principle you can do so by only changing the Pre-processing and Case configuration without touching the core tracking module. You are encouraged to contribute your download scripts as well as prepocessing files to the WAM2layers Github repository.

## Code development
In case you are part of the development team (or want to become part of it), the [Developer's guide](./develop.md) is meant to help maintaining the code on Github, Zenodo and this documentation.
