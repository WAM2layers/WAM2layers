# TODO: timestep can be removed
timestep: 3600  # s; ERA5 data comes at hourly time steps
# TODO: Remove divt, should be changed to calculation time step used in tracking
# Consult readme for guidance on time step configuration
divt: 60  # division of the timestep, 96 means a calculation timestep of 24/96 = 0.25 hours (numerical stability purposes) --> Do the current chosen values of 3600 and 60 mean a division in a 60 seconds (1 minute) time step? 

# Tracking options
Kvf: 3  # vertical dispersion factor (advection only is 0, dispersion the same size of the advective flux is 1, for stability don't make this more than 3)
timetracking: false  # false for not tracking time and true for tracking time
veryfirstrun: true  # true if no run has been done before from which can be continued, otherwise false

#TODO: Add start tracking time and end tracking time?
