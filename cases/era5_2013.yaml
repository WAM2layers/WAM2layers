# divt & count_time
divt: 60  # division of the timestep, 96 means a calculation timestep of 24/96 = 0.25 hours (numerical stability purposes)
count_time: 24  # number of indices to get data from (24 timesteps a day, 1-hourly data from ERA5)

# Backtracking options
Kvf: 3  # vertical dispersion factor (advection only is 0, dispersion the same size of the advective flux is 1, for stability don't make this more than 3)
timetracking: false  # false for not tracking time and true for tracking time
veryfirstrun: true  # true if no run has been done before from which can be continued, otherwise false
