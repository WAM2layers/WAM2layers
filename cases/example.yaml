# divt & count_time
divt: 60  # division of the timestep, 96 means a calculation timestep of 24/96 = 0.25 hours (numerical stability purposes)
count_time: 4  # number of indices to get data from (4 timesteps a day, 6-hourly data)

# Manage the extent of your dataset
# Define the latitude and longitude cell numbers to consider and corresponding lakes that should be considered part of the land
latnrs: 267 #np.arange(0, 267)  # minimal domain
lonnrs: 444 #np.arange(0, 444)

isglobal: 0  # fill in 1 for global computations (i.e. Earth round), fill in 0 for a local domain with boundaries

# Backtracking options
Kvf: 3  # vertical dispersion factor (advection only is 0, dispersion the same size of the advective flux is 1, for stability don't make this more than 3)
timetracking: 0  # 0 for not tracking time and 1 for tracking time
veryfirstrun: 1  # type '1' if no run has been done before from which can be continued, otherwise type '0'
